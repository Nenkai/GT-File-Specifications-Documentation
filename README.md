# GT5-File-Specifications
File specifications for various Gran Turismo 5 file types.

This is an on-going effort to document file types used by Gran Turismo 5. 
Any help is welcome.

The provided files were created through 010 Editor, but should be fairly readable. (Aside from the names assigned to unknown variables and struct fields).

MDL3 -> Model files, used for cars, wheels, sky. Contains model images, reflection & light data, original file names, mesh groups, textures.
TXS3 -> Texture files, originally DDS Images.
