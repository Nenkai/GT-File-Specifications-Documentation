File specifications & documentation for various Gran Turismo 4/5/6/7/? file types.

This is an on-going effort to document file types.
Any help is welcome.

The provided files (templates) were created through 010 Editor, but should be fairly readable. (Aside from the names assigned to unknown variables and struct fields).
Simply loading your target file in 010 Editor, and run the template against your file and start reversing.
